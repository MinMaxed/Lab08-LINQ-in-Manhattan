# Lab08-LINQ-in-Manhattan


## Description
Given a json file with Manhatten based locations, this program is converting the .json into C# objects. Using LINQ and Lambda Queries, the data filters out Neighborhoods that have values/no blank names, Groups them together by neighborhood, then makes sure there are no duplicates names. That is stored in a variable so that they can be printed out on the Console.
